# Obsidian Learning Hub
Author : Polaire

## Informations

This repository will be updated when i learn new things, and when i will have time to update it.

It will contain :
- Sources
  - Scientific papers
  - Articles
  - Podcasts
  - Books (link to buy or PDF)
- Lessons / Courses
  - Links to lessons made by peoples online
  - Links to free courses online
  - Lessons wrote by me, simplified and based on scientific papers and/or other sources that i used to learn.

## Objectives

The objective for me is to have a place where i can find back all the things i learned, and also be able to make my knowledge stay in my head.
I make this repository public so other peoples can learn without the pain of having to search all the things and keeping the errors out.

**DISCLAIMER :** I am only an IT student, I am not pretending to know everything and that all the things that will be in this repository are a 100% perfect and that there will be no errors, I am just sharing my journey on learning subjects that are interesting to me, and also getting back all the knowledge I should have.

## Subjects

To this day I plan to write about :
- Artificial Intelligence
- Mathematics
- Neuroscience
- Biotechnologies
  
It will probably evolve in the future with other topics such as sport, nutrition, etc...

## Installation

First install **Obsidian**
https://obsidian.md/

Then, install git on your computer.

Then, open the folder where you want to clone the repository.  
Open your terminal and type :
```
git init
git pull https://github.com/PolaireP/Obsidian-Learning-Hub
```

**DISLCAIMER :**   
Since I am new to Obsidian, and since I never done a public repository with the view of having it being pulled, it might actually not work, if so I will find a way, but it might take some time.

Also, it might take months before there is actually anything being pushed to the repo, I actually do not have enough time to learn and rewrite everything, please just be patient because I also want to learn but unfortunately I have other (school and personnal) projects to work on.


## What's Next ?

In the future I'd like to actually make this repo into a website where peoples will be able to learn more easily (not a problem for devs, but peoples who don't know how to use git will not find the git format convenient).
